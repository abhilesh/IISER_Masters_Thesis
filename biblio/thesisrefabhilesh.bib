abstract = {Arginine is an abundant residue in protein-protein interfaces. The importance of this residue relates to the versatility of its side chain in intermolecular interactions. Different classes of protein-protein interfaces were surveyed for cation-pi interactions. Approximately half of the protein complexes and one-third of the homodimers analyzed were found to contain at least one intermolecular cation-pi pair. Interactions between arginine and tyrosine were found to be the most abundant. The electrostatic interaction energy was calculated to be approximately 3 kcal/mol, on average. A distance-based search of guanidinium:aromatic interactions was also performed using the Macromolecular Structure Database (MSD). This search revealed that half of the guanidinium:aromatic pairs pack in a coplanar manner. Furthermore, it was found that the cationic group of the cation-pi pair is frequently involved in intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In this manner the arginine side chain can participate in multiple interactions, providing a mechanism for inter-protein specificity. Thus, the cation-pi interaction is established as an important contributor to protein-protein interfaces.},

abstract = {Proteins function through interactions with other molecules. Thus, the network of physical interactions among proteins is of great interest to both experimental and computational biologists. Here we present structure-based predictions of 3387 binary and 1234 higher order protein complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae involving 924 and 195 proteins, respectively. To generate candidate complexes, comparative models of individual proteins were built and combined together using complexes of known structure as templates. These candidate complexes were then assessed using a statistical potential, derived from binary domain interfaces in PIBASE (http://salilab.org/pibase). The statistical potential discriminated a benchmark set of 100 interface structures from a set of sequence-randomized negative examples with a false positive rate of 3\% and a true positive rate of 97\%. Moreover, the predicted complexes were also filtered using functional annotation and sub-cellular localization data. The ability of the method to select the correct binding mode among alternates is demonstrated for three camelid VHH domain-porcine alpha-amylase interactions. We also highlight the prediction of co-complexed domain superfamilies that are not present in template complexes. Through integration with MODBASE, the application of the method to proteomes that are less well characterized than that of S.cerevisiae will contribute to expansion of the structural and functional coverage of protein interaction space. The predicted complexes are deposited in MODBASE (http://salilab.org/modbase).},

abstract = {Attractive inter-residue contact energies for proteins have been re-evaluated with the same assumptions and approximations used originally by us in 1985, but with a significantly larger set of protein crystal structures. An additional repulsive packing energy term, operative at higher densities to prevent overpacking, has also been estimated for all 20 amino acids as a function of the number of contacting residues, based on their observed distributions. The two terms of opposite sign are intended to be used together to provide an estimate of the overall energies of inter-residue interactions in simplified proteins without atomic details. To overcome the problem of how to utilize the many homologous proteins in the Protein Data Bank, a new scheme has been devised to assign different weights to each protein, based on similarities among amino acid sequences. A total of 1168 protein structures containing 1661 subunit sequences are actually used here. After the sequence weights have been applied, these correspond to an effective number of residue-residue contacts of 113,914, or about six times more than were used in the old analysis. Remarkably, the new attractive contact energies are nearly identical to the old ones, except for those with Leu and the rarer amino acids Trp and Met. The largest change found for Leu is surprising. The estimates of hydrophobicity from the contact energies for non-polar side-chains agree well with the experimental values. In an application of these contact energies, the sequences of 88 structurally distinct proteins in the Protein Data Bank are threaded at all possible positions without gaps into 189 different folds of proteins whose sequences differ from each other by at least 35\% sequence identity. The native structures for 73 of 88 proteins, excluding 15 exceptional proteins such as membrane proteins, are all demonstrated to have the lowest alignment energies.},

In vivo, the protomer's localization, concentration and local environment can affect the interaction between protomers and are vital to control the composition and oligomeric state of protein complexes. Since a change in quaternary state is often coupled with biological function or activity, transient PPIs are important biological regulators.

abstract = {Non-covalent residue side-chain interactions occur in many different types of proteins and facilitate many biological functions. Are these differences manifested in the sequence compositions and/or the residue-residue contact preferences of the interfaces? Previous studies analysed small data sets and gave contradictory answers. Here, we introduced a new data-mining method that yielded the largest high-resolution data set of interactions analysed. We introduced an information theory-based analysis method. On the basis of sequence features, we were able to differentiate six types of protein interfaces, each corresponding to a different functional or structural association between residues. Particularly, we found significant differences in amino acid composition and residue-residue preferences between interactions of residues within the same structural domain and between different domains, between permanent and transient interfaces, and between interactions associating homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers. The differences between the six types were so substantial that, using amino acid composition alone, we could predict statistically to which of the six types of interfaces a pool of 1000 residues belongs at 63-100\% accuracy. All interfaces differed significantly from the background of all residues in SWISS-PROT, from the group of surface residues, and from internal residues that were not involved in non-trivial interactions. Overall, our results suggest that the interface type could be predicted from sequence and that interface-type specific mean-field potentials may be adequate for certain applications. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Rajamani2004,
abstract = {We show that the mechanism for molecular recognition requires one of the interacting proteins, usually the smaller of the two, to anchor a specific side chain in a structurally constrained binding groove of the other protein, providing a steric constraint that helps to stabilize a native-like bound intermediate. We identify the anchor residues in 39 protein-protein complexes and verify that, even in the absence of their interacting partners, the anchor side chains are found in conformations similar to those observed in the bound complex. These ready-made recognition motifs correspond to surface side chains that bury the largest solvent-accessible surface area after forming the complex (> or =100 A2). The existence of such anchors implies that binding pathways can avoid kinetically costly structural rearrangements at the core of the binding interface, allowing for a relatively smooth recognition process. Once anchors are docked, an induced fit process further contributes to forming the final high-affinity complex. This later stage involves flexible (solvent-exposed) side chains that latch to the encounter complex in the periphery of the binding pocket. Our results suggest that the evolutionary conservation of anchor side chains applies to the actual structure that these residues assume before the encounter complex and not just to their loci. Implications for protein docking are also discussed.},

It is thus not possible to account for the stability of assocn. complexes of proteins on the basis of hydrophobic interactions alone.  A conceptual model of protein assocn. is presented consisting of 2 steps: the mutual penetration of hydration layers causing disordering of the solvent, followed by further short-range interactions.  The net $\Delta$G0 for the complete assocn. process is primarily detd. by the pos. entropy change accompanying the 1st step and the neg. enthalpy change of the 2nd step.  On the basis of the thermochem. behavior of small mol. interactions, the strengthening of H bonds in the low dielec. macromol. interior and van der Waals' interactions introduced as a consequence of the hydrophobic effect are the most important factors contributing to the obsd. neg. values of $\Delta$H0 and $\Delta$S0 and hence to the stability of protein assocn. complexes.  The x-ray crystallog. structures of these complexes is consonant with this anal.  The tendency for protein assocn. reactions to become entropy dominated and(or) entropy-enthalpy assisted at low temps. and enthalpy dominated at high temps. (a consequence of the typically neg. values of $\Delta$Cp0) arises from the diminution of the hydrophobic effect with increasing temp. which is a general property of the solvent, water.

abstract = {We describe a comparative protein modelling method designed to find the most probable structure for a sequence given its alignment with related structures. The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C alpha-C alpha distances, main-chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by the modelling of trypsin from two other serine proteinases.},

Literature and personal experience have guided us to conclude that the problems concerning the ETL tools are primarily problems of complexity, usability and price. To deal with these problems we provide a uniform metamodel for ETL processes, covering the aspects of data warehouse architecture, activity modeling, contingency treatment and quality management. The ETL tool we have developed, namely Arktos, is capable of modeling and executing practical ETL scenarios by providing explicit primitives for the capturing of common tasks. Arktos provides three ways to describe an ETL scenario: a graphical point-and-click front end and two declarative languages: XADL (an XML variant), which is more verbose and easy to read and SADL (an SQL-like language) which has a quite compact syntax and is, thus, easier for authoring.},

abstract = {We present a prototype of a new approach to the folding problem of polypeptide chains. This approach is based on the analysis of known protein structures. It derives the energy potentials for the atomic interactions of all amino acid residue pairs as a function of the distance between the involved atoms. These potentials are then used to calculate the energies of all conformations that exist in the data base with respect to a given sequence. Then, by using only the most stable conformations, clusters of the most probable conformations for the given sequence are obtained. To discuss the results properly we introduce a new classification of segments based on their conformational stability. Special care is taken to allow for sparse data sets. The use of the method is demonstrated in the discussion of the identical oligopeptide sequences found in different conformations in unrelated proteins. VNTFV, for example, adopts a beta-strand in ribonuclease but it is found in an alpha-helical conformation in erythrocruorin. In the case of VNTFV the ensemble obtained consists of a single cluster of beta-strand conformations, indicating that this may be the preferred conformation for the pentapeptide. When the flanking residues are included in the calculation the hepapeptide P-VNTFV-H (ribonuclease) again yields an ensemble of beta-strands. However, in the ensemble of D-VNTFV-A (erythrocruorin) the major cluster is of alpha-helical type. In the present study we concentrate on the local aspects of protein conformations. However, the theory presented is quite general and not restricted to oligopeptides. We indicate extensions of the approach to the calculation of global conformations of proteins as well as conceivable applications to a number of molecular systems.},

In this paper the empirical interaction parameters, used as a measure of the medium- and long-range interactions (the standard free energy, deltaGdegrees k,l, of formation of a contact between amino acids of species k and l) that include the role of the solvent (water) and determine the conformation of a protein in steps B and C, are evaluated from the frequency of contacts in the x-ray structures of native proteins. The numerical values of deltaG degrees k,l for all possible pairs of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids are presented. Contacts between highly nonpolar side chains of amino acids such as Ile, Phe, Trp, and Leu are shown quantitatively to be stable. On the contrary, contacts involving polar side chains of amino acids such as Ser, Asp, Lys, and Glu are significantly less stable. While this implies, in a quantitative manner, that it is generally more favorable for nonpolar groups to lie in the interior of the protein molecule and for the polar side chains to be exposed to the solvent (water) rather than to form contacts with other amino acids, many exceptions to this generalization are observed.},

Our goal in culling the PDB is to provide the longest list possible of the highest resolution structures that fulfill the sequence identity and structural quality cut-offs. The new PISCES server uses a combination of PSI-BLAST and structure-based alignments to determine sequence identities. Structure alignment produces more complete alignments and therefore more accurate sequence identities than PSI-BLAST. PISCES now allows a user to cull the PDB by-entry in addition to the standard culling by individual chains. In this scenario, a list will contain only entries that do not have a chain that has a sequence identity to any chain in any other entry in the list over the sequence identity cut-off. PISCES also provides fully annotated sequences including gene name and species. The server allows a user to cull an input list of entries or chains, so that other criteria, such as function, can be used. Results from a search on the re-engineered RCSB's site for the PDB can be entered into the PISCES server by a single click, combining the powerful searching abilities of the PDB with PISCES's utilities for sequence culling. The server's data are updated weekly. The server is available at http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/pisces.},

abstract = {Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes predispose women to familial, early-onset breast cancer. Both the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins appear to function in the homologous recombination pathway of DNA double-strand break repair. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 have also been implicated in transcription by RNA polymerase II, for both proteins have domains which, when tethered adjacent to a promoter, can activate transcription. In experiments reported here, we have used protein affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation techniques to show that the putative N-terminal acidic transcriptional activation domain of BRCA2 interacts with replication protein A (RPA), a protein essential for DNA repair, replication and recombination. This interaction was not mediated by DNA and was specific for human RPA but not yeast RPA. Since the cancer-predisposing mutation Y42C in BRCA2 significantly compromised the interaction between RPA and BRCA2, this interaction may be biologically important. That BRCA2 protein in HeLa cell extract also coimmunoprecipitated with RPA suggested that this interaction occurs in vivo. Therefore, the transcriptional activation domains within BRCA2, and perhaps BRCA1, may provide links to RPA and DNA repair processes rather than transcription.},

abstract = {To understand further, and to utilize, the interactions across protein-protein interfaces, we carried out an analysis of the hydrogen bonds and of the salt bridges in a collection of 319 non-redundant protein-protein interfaces derived from high-quality X-ray structures. We found that the geometry of the hydrogen bonds across protein interfaces is generally less optimal and has a wider distribution than typically observed within the chains. This difference originates from the more hydrophilic side chains buried in the binding interface than in the folded monomer interior. Protein folding differs from protein binding. Whereas in folding practically all degrees of freedom are available to the chain to attain its optimal configuration, this is not the case for rigid binding, where the protein molecules are already folded, with only six degrees of translational and rotational freedom available to the chains to achieve their most favorable bound configuration. These constraints enforce many polar/charged residues buried in the interface to form weak hydrogen bonds with protein atoms, rather than strongly hydrogen bonding to the solvent. Since interfacial hydrogen bonds are weaker than the intra-chain ones to compete with the binding of water, more water molecules are involved in bridging hydrogen bond networks across the protein interface than in the protein interior. Interfacial water molecules both mediate non-complementary donor-donor or acceptor-acceptor pairs, and connect non-optimally oriented donor-acceptor pairs. These differences between the interfacial hydrogen bonding patterns and the intra-chain ones further substantiate the notion that protein complexes formed by rigid binding may be far away from the global minimum conformations. Moreover, we summarize the pattern of charge complementarity and of the conservation of hydrogen bond network across binding interfaces. We further illustrate the utility of this study in understanding the specificity of protein-protein associations, and hence in docking prediction and molecular (inhibitor) design.},

Recombinant pro-tryptase epsilon was generated to understand how the exocytosed zymogen might be activated outside of the epithelial cell, as well as to address its possible role in normal and diseased states. Using expression/site-directed mutagenesis approaches, we now show that Lys20, Cys90, and Asp92 in the protease's substrate-binding cleft regulate its enzymatic activity. We also show that Arg(-1) in the propeptide domain controls its ability to autoactivate. In vitro studies revealed that recombinant tryptase epsilon possesses a restricted substrate specificity. Once activated, tryptase epsilon cannot be inhibited effectively by the diverse array of protease inhibitors present in normal human plasma. Moreover, this epithelium protease is not highly susceptible to alpha1-antitrypsin or secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, which are present in the lung. Recombinant tryptase epsilon could not cleave fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin, single-chain tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen, or any prominent serum protein. Nevertheless, tryptase epsilon readily converted single-chain pro-urokinase-type plasminogen activator (pro-uPA/scuPA) into its mature, enzymatically active protease. Tryptase epsilon also was able to induce pro-uPA-expressing smooth muscle cells to increase their migration through a basement membrane-like extracellular matrix. The ability to activate uPA in the presence of varied protease inhibitors suggests that tryptase epsilon plays a prominent role in fibrinolysis and other uPA-dependent reactions in the lung.},

Much of our present knowledge derives from high-throughput techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid assay and affinity purification, as well as from manual curation of experiments on individual systems. A variety of computational approaches based, for example, on sequence homology, gene co-expression and phylogenetic profiles, have also been developed for the genome-wide inference of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Yet comparative studies suggest that the development of accurate and complete repertoires of PPIs is still in its early stages. Here we show that three-dimensional structural information can be used to predict PPIs with an accuracy and coverage that are superior to predictions based on non-structural evidence. Moreover, an algorithm, termed PrePPI, which combines structural information with other functional clues, is comparable in accuracy to high-throughput experiments, yielding over 30,000 high-confidence interactions for yeast and over 300,000 for human. Experimental tests of a number of predictions demonstrate the ability of the PrePPI algorithm to identify unexpected PPIs of considerable biological interest. The surprising effectiveness of three-dimensional structural information can be attributed to the use of homology models combined with the exploitation of both close and remote geometric relationships between proteins.},

Computer graphics analysis of these structures shows that most of the Arg-Arg pairs are found in the vicinity of the surface of the proteins, in an easily hydrated region. In order to determine which factors could stabilize such arrangements of species of similar charge, we have carried out AM1 semi-empirical calculations on a model of two guanidinium ions surrounded by several water molecules. The results show the existence of stable clusters with six or more water molecules, with distances between C zeta atoms around 3 A. The bridging role of the water molecules is an important structural and energetic feature and we find bridges of two and three molecules between the guanidinium ions. These results are in good agreement with the structures found in our search of the experimental data. Enhancement of the electrostatic potential around these clusters, when compared to one of the guanidinium ions alone, is also demonstrated.},

abstract = {An understanding of the forces that contribute to stability is pivotal in solving the protein-folding problem. Classical theory suggests that disulfide bonds stabilize proteins by reducing the entropy of the denatured state. More recent theories have attempted to expand this idea, suggesting that in addition to configurational entropic effects, enthalpic and native-state effects occur and cannot be neglected. Experimental thermodynamic evidence is examined from two sources: (1) the disruption of naturally occurring disulfides, and (2) the insertion of novel disulfides. The data confirm that enthalpic and native-state effects are often significant. The experimental changes in free energy are compared to those predicted by different theories. The differences between theory and experiment are large near 300 K and do not lend support to any of the current theories regarding the stabilization of proteins by disulfide bonds. This observation is a result of not only deficiencies in the theoretical models but also from difficulties in determining the effects of disulfide bonds on protein stability against the backdrop of numerous subtle stabilizing factors (in both the native and denatured states), which they may also affect.},

@article{Heyda2010,
abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of histidine-based dipeptides in water show that a protonated histidine side chain group has a propensity for forming like-charged contact pairs with another protonated histidine or with arginine. This effect is of similar strength to that in previously observed arginine-arginine pairing. Even stronger contact pairs are formed in singly protonated or deprotonated dihistidine, where stacking of aromatic rings is not weakened by Coulomb repulsion between the side chains. Similar pairing behavior is also observed in a mixed solution of imidazole and imidazolium chloride.},
